Fate Automated Testing Environment

Fate provides a regression testsuite that can be run locally or configured
to send reports to fate.libav.org.
In order to run it needs a large amount of data (samples and references) that
is provided separately from the actual source distribution.

Use the following command to get the fate test samples

# mkdir fate/fate-suite
# rsync -aL rsync://samples.libav.org:/samples/fate-suite/ fate/fate-suite

pass `--samples=<path to the samples>` to configure or pass the path with the
SAMPLES variable to make.

For information on how to set a reporting fate please refer to the following
wiki page:

Fate Makefile targets:

fate-list
    Will list all fate/regression test targets.

fate
    Run the fate test suite, note you must have installed it.

Fate Makefile variables:

V
    Verbosity level, can be set to 0, 1 or 2.
    * Level 0 will show just the test arguments
    * Level 1 will show just the command used in the test
    * Level 2 will show everything

SAMPLES
    Specify or override the path to the fate samples at make time, it has a
    meaning only while running the regression tests.

THREADS
    Specify how many threads to use while running regression tests, it is
    quite useful to detect thread-related regression.

Example:
    make V=1 SAMPLES=/var/fate/samples THREADS=2 fate
